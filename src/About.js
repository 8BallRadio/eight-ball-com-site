OUR MISSION
8-Ball Community Inc. is an independent not-for-profit organization that — through free, open-access platforms and events — nurtures and supports a community of artists. We provide virtual and physical meeting sites for people of all ages, gender and backgrounds. Our mission is to generate collaborative and educational exchange through public access television and radio stations, an imprint, a self publishing fair, a public library, an internship program, a residency and series of workshops in art-related trades. 8-Ball Community operates free of elitism and is governed by its participants.

8-Ball Zine Fair started in 2012 at Grand Billiards in Brooklyn, NY. Always happens in a pool hall, and has been reproduced in other cities around the world, including Tokyo and San Francisco. The Drop Off table, placed at the centre of the fair, also represents the core of the community, un-selected and free, allows everyone to participate and show their work.


A Brief History
8 Ball came from an un-planned and spontaneous decision made by three friends to help a small Billiard Hall in Brooklyn from going out of business.
Between January and July of 2012, Grand Billiard hosted events, parties, screenings, launches and other sorts of gatherings. Then in June of that year, they decided to invite local publishers and artists to show and sell their products on the pool tables. This was the first 8-Ball zine fair.
The fair now repeats twice a year in NYC and once in SF.
8-Ball Community has expanded since then, producing other events, a radio station, a public access TV, workshops, parties, libraries, books, zines, a gallery, a members-only club and a special newsstand that sold only self publications and lived for 7 months in the subway system of NY, The Newsstand, now reproduced as an installation part of the New Photography 2015 show at the Museum of Modern Art in NYC.
